# Forkable_Strings
This repo contains a short and incomplete Isabelle proof script for the section 4.2: Forkable Strings in Aggelos Kiayias et al's Ouroboros: A Provably Secure Proof-of-Stake Blockchain Protocol (it is still not up-to-date compared to https://eprint.iacr.org/2016/889.pdf)

- All definitions up to 4.16

- Still messy, I will clean and add more comments soon

- Now modifying a formalisation of a set of pairs of disjoint-edged tines because it is too complicated

- This work doesn't include work on the proofs of Proposition 4.17 and Lemma 4.18, and I will add more lemmas, which will help prove these two, when they get improved and cleaned

- For creating document, look in Forkable_Strings.Zip, I now use [quick_and_dirty] mode as there are two 'sorry's
